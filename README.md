# Shrinkpdf: shrink PDF files with Ghostscript

[![Shellcheck](https://github.com/aklomp/shrinkpdf/actions/workflows/shellcheck.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/aklomp/shrinkpdf/actions/workflows/shellcheck.yml)

A simple wrapper around Ghostscript to shrink PDFs (as in reduce filesize)
under Linux. Inspired by some code I found in an OpenOffice Python script (I
think). The script feeds a PDF through Ghostscript, which performs lossy
recompression by such methods as downsampling the images to 72dpi. The result
should be (but not always is) a much smaller file.

## Usage

Download the script and make it executable. If you run it with no arguments, it
prints a usage summary. If you run it with a single argument -- the name of the
pdf to shrink -- it writes the result to `stdout`:

```sh
./shrinkpdf.sh in.pdf > out.pdf
```

You can also provide a second filename for the output:

```sh
./shrinkpdf.sh in.pdf out.pdf
```

And an output resolution in DPI (default is 72 DPI):

```sh
./shrinkpdf.sh in.pdf out.pdf 90
```

If both the input and the output are regular files, the script checks if the
output is actually smaller. If not, it writes a message to `stderr` and copies
the input over the output.

Sorry, Windows users; this one is Linux only. A Windows adaptation of this
script can be found [on this blog](http://dcm684.us/wp/2013/10/pdf-shrink/).
It's a bit more user-friendly than my barebones version and also supports
drag-and-drop.
